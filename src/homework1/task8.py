codewars katas for homework #1

Из-за того что это не классический "модульный" файл, а "куски" кода это
решения отдельной каты со своими импортами (реимпортами), переопределением имён функций и переменных
то отключены соответствующие проверки pylint и flake8

Задач было нарешано больше 100, но среди 7 и 8 kyu было крайне мало тех,
что заставляли задуматься больше чем на 5-15 минут, сюда собрал только 6-4 kyu

# replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.
# If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it.
# "a" = 1, "b" = 2, etc.
# Example
# alphabet_position("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")
# Should return:
# "20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11" ( as a string )

# 3. Are they the "same"?
# Rank: 6
# URL: https://www.codewars.com/kata/550498447451fbbd7600041c
# Given two arrays a and b write a function comp(a, b) (orcompSame(a, b))
# that checks whether the two arrays have the "same" elements, with the same multiplicities
# (the multiplicity of a member is the number of times it appears).
# "Same" means, here, that the elements in b are the elements in a squared, regardless of the order.
# Examples
# Valid arrays
# a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]
# b = [121, 14641, 20736, 361, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]
# comp(a, b) returns true because in b 121 is the square of 11, 14641 is the square of 121,
# 20736 the square of 144, 361 the square of 19, 25921 the square of 161, and so on.
# It gets obvious if we write b's elements in terms of squares:
# a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]
# b = [11*11, 121*121, 144*144, 19*19, 161*161, 19*19, 144*144, 19*19]
# Invalid arrays
# If, for example, we change the first number to something else, comp is not returning true anymore:
# a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]

# For example:
# 'abba' & 'baab' == true
# 'abba' & 'bbaa' == true
# 'abba' & 'abbba' == false
# 'abba' & 'abca' == false
# Write a function that will find all the anagrams of a word from a list.
# You will be given two inputs a word and an array with words.
# You should return an array of all the anagrams or an empty array if there are none.
# For example:
# anagrams('abba', ['aabb', 'abcd', 'bbaa', 'dada']) => ['aabb', 'bbaa']
# anagrams('racer', ['crazer', 'carer', 'racar', 'caers', 'racer']) => ['carer', 'racer']

# 7. Memoized Fibonacci
# Rank: 5
# URL: https://www.codewars.com/kata/529adbf7533b761c560004e5
# Problem Context
# The Fibonacci sequence is traditionally used to explain tree recursion.
# def fibonacci(n):
#     if n in [0, 1]:
#         return n
#     return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
# This algorithm serves welll its educative purpose but it's tremendously inefficient,
# not only because of recursion, but because we invoke the fibonacci function twice,
# and the right branch of recursion (i.e. fibonacci(n-2)) recalculates all the Fibonacci numbers
# already calculated by the left branch
# (i.e. fibonacci(n-1)).
# This algorithm is so inefficient that the time to calculate any Fibonacci number over 50
# is simply too much.
# You may go for a cup of coffee or go take a nap while you wait for the answer.
# But if you try it here in Code Wars you will most likely get a code timeout before any answers.
# For this particular Kata we want to implement the memoization solution.
# This will be cool because it will let us keep using the tree recursion algorithm
# while still keeping it sufficiently optimized
# to get an answer very rapidly.
# The trick of the memoized version is that we will keep a cache data structure
# (most likely an associative array) where we will store the Fibonacci numbers as we calculate them.
# When a Fibonacci number is calculated, we first look it up in the cache,
# if it's not there, we calculate it and put it in the cache,
# otherwise we returned the cached number.
# Refactor the function into a recursive Fibonacci function that using a memoized data structure
# avoids the deficiencies of tree recursion.
# Can you make it so the memoization cache is private to this function?
cache = [0, 1, 1]

# 8. Matrix Determinant
# Rank: 4
# URL: https://www.codewars.com/kata/52a382ee44408cea2500074c
# Write a function that accepts a square matrix (N x N 2D array) and returns the determinant
# of the matrix.
# How to take the determinant of a matrix -- it is simplest to start with the smallest cases:
# A 1x1 matrix |a| has determinant a.
# A 2x2 matrix [ [a, b], [c, d] ] or
# |a  b|
# |c  d|
# has determinant: a*d - b*c.
# The determinant of an n x n sized matrix is calculated by reducing the problem
# to the calculation of the determinants of n matrices ofn-1 x n-1 size.
# For the 3x3 case, [ [a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i] ] or
# |a b c|
# |d e f|
# |g h i|
# the determinant is: a * det(a_minor) - b * det(b_minor) + c * det(c_minor) where det(a_minor)
# refers to taking the determinant of the 2x2 matrix
# created by crossing out the row and column in which the element a occurs:
# |- - -|
# |- e f|
# |- h i|
# Note the alternation of signs.
# The determinant of larger matrices are calculated analogously, e.g. if M is a 4x4 matrix
# with first row [a, b, c, d], then:
# det(M) = a * det(a_minor) - b * det(b_minor) + c * det(c_minor) - d * det(d_minor)

# 10. Directions Reduction

# Once upon a time, on a way through the old wild mountainous west,…
# … a man was given directions to go from one point to another.
# The directions were "NORTH", "SOUTH", "WEST", "EAST".
# Clearly "NORTH" and "SOUTH" are opposite, "WEST" and "EAST" too.
# Going to one direction and coming back the opposite direction right away is a needless effort.
# Since this is the wild west, with dreadfull weather and not much water,
# it's important to save yourself some energy, otherwise you might die of thirst!
# How I crossed a mountainous desert the smart way.
# The directions given to the man are, for example, the following (depending on the language):
# ["NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST"].
# or
# { "NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST" };
# or
# [North, South, South, East, West, North, West]
# You can immediatly see that going "NORTH" and immediately "SOUTH" is not reasonable,
# better stay to the same place! So the task is to give to the man a simplified version of the plan.
# A better plan in this case is simply:
# ["WEST"]
# or
# { "WEST" }
# or
# [West]
# Other examples:
# In ["NORTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST"]
# the direction "NORTH" + "SOUTH" is going north and coming back right away.
# The path becomes ["EAST", "WEST"], now "EAST" and "WEST" annihilate each other,
# therefore, the final result is [] (nil in Clojure).
# In ["NORTH", "EAST", "WEST", "SOUTH", "WEST", "WEST"], "NORTH" and "SOUTH"
# are not directly opposite but they become directly opposite after the reduction
# of "EAST" and "WEST" so the whole path is reducible to ["WEST", "WEST"].
# Task
# Write a function dirReduc which will take an array of strings and
# returns an array of strings with the needless directions removed (W<->E or S<->N side by side).
# The Haskell version takes a list of directions with data Direction = North | East | West | South.
# The Clojure version returns nil when the path is reduced to nothing.
# The Rust version takes a slice of enum Direction {North, East, West, South}.

# For example, the array arr = [0, 1, 2, 5, 1, 0] has a peak at position 3
# with a value of 5 (since arr[3] equals 5).
# The output will be returned as an object with two properties: pos and peaks.
# Both of these properties should be arrays.
# If there is no peak in the given array, then the output should be {pos: [], peaks: []}.
# Example: pickPeaks([3, 2, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3])
# should return {pos: [3, 7], peaks: [6, 3]} (or equivalent in other languages)
# All input arrays will be valid integer arrays (although it could still be empty),
# so you won't need to validate the input.
# The first and last elements of the array will not be considered as peaks
# (in the context of a mathematical function, we don't know what is after and before and therefore,
# we don't know if it is a peak or not).
# Also, beware of plateaus !!! [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] has a peak while [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]

# Sudoku Background
# Sudoku is a game played on a 9x9 grid.
# The goal of the game is to fill all cells of the grid with digits from 1 to 9,
# so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 sub-grids (also known as blocks)
# contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.
# (More info at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku)
# Sudoku Solution Validator
# Write a function validSolution/ValidateSolution/valid_solution()
# that accepts a 2D array representing a Sudoku board, and returns true if it is a valid solution,
# or false otherwise.
# The cells of the sudoku board may also contain 0's, which will represent empty cells.
# Boards containing one or more zeroes are considered to be invalid solutions.
# The board is always 9 cells by 9 cells, and every cell only contains integers from 0 to 9.

# A child is playing with a ball on the nth floor of a tall building.
# The height of this floor, h, is known.
# He drops the ball out of the window.
# The ball bounces (for example), to two-thirds of its height (a bounce of 0.66).
# His mother looks out of a window 1.5 meters from the ground.
# How many times will the mother see the ball pass in front of her window
# (including when it's falling and bouncing?
# Three conditions must be met for a valid experiment:
# Float parameter "h" in meters must be greater than 0
# Float parameter "bounce" must be greater than 0 and less than 1
# Float parameter "window" must be less than h.
# If all three conditions above are fulfilled, return a positive integer, otherwise return -1.
# Note:
# The ball can only be seen if the height of the rebounding ball is strictly greater
# than the window parameter.
# Examples:
# - h = 3, bounce = 0.66, window = 1.5, result is 3
# - h = 3, bounce = 1, window = 1.5, result is -1 (Condition 2) not fulfilled).

# If the string already ends with a number, the number should be incremented by 1.
# If the string does not end with a number. the number 1 should be appended to the new string.
# Examples:
# foo -> foo1
# foobar23 -> foobar24
# foo0042 -> foo0043
# foo9 -> foo10
# foo099 -> foo100
# Attention: If the number has leading zeros the amount of digits should be considered.
